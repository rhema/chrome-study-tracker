In contrast to previous work in this field that uses content terms to represent documents, the proposed method is based on a small list of stopwords (i.e., very frequent words). We show that stopword n-grams reveal important information for plagiarism detection since they are able to capture syntactic similarities between suspicious and original documents and they can be used to detect the exact plagiarized passage boundaries. Experimental results on a publicly available corpus demonstrate that the performance of the proposed approach is competitive when compared with the best reported results. More importantly, it achieves significantly better results when dealing with difficult plagiarism cases where the plagiarized passages are highly modified and most of the words or phrases have been replaced with synonyms. ￂﾩ 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2229000&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2229000"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Plagiarism detection using stopword n-grams","text":"Plagiarism detection using stopword n-grams","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"787439869"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100152214&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0&cfid=196319304&cftoken=68985144","name":"Efstathios Stamatatos","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1026567&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Department of Information and Communication Systems Engineering, University of the Aegean, 83200, Karlovassi, Greece"}]}}]},"rich_media":{"mm_name":"rich_media","title":"PDF full text"},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology            \n\t\t           tableￂﾠofￂﾠcontents\n\t\t\t    \n              archive","articles":{"acm_portal":[{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2229011&preflayout=flat","title":"Don't confuse accreditation with reputation","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81502713820&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","name":"Blaise Cronin"}]}},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2228992&preflayout=flat","title":"Social Q&A","abstract":"This article presents a review and analysis of the research literature in social Q&A (SQA), a term describing systems where people ask, answer, and rate content while interacting around it.
