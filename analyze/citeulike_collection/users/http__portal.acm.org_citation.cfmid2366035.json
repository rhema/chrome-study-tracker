In this paper, I survey visual approaches that go beyond presenting the recommended items as a textual list or as annotations in context. I also review related literature from recommendations' explanations. In this thesis, I aim to understand how different visualizations and some personal traits might influence users' assessment of recommended items, particularly in domains where multidimensional data or contextual constraints are involved. I present the prototype of 2 recommendation visualizations and then briefly propose the research approach of this investigation.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2366035&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2366035&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2366035"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Beyond lists: studying the effect of different recommendation visualizations","text":"Beyond lists: studying the effect of different recommendation visualizations","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1624303363"}}}],"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Tintarev, N."},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Masthoff, J."}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source"}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","title":"M. and Willemsen","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Knijnenburg, B.
