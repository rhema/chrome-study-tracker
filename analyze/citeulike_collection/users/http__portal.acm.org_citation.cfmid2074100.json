In this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical Bayesian methods. We compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. We use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. The first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. The second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. This metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list. Experiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metr rics for the various algorithms. Results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, Bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform Bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. Between correlation and Bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. Other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2074100&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2074100&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2074100"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering","text":"Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"537513228"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100426598","name":"John S.
