Since then a series of ad-hoc techniques have been proposed in the literature, though none are known to be provably private. In this paper, we take a major step towards a solution: we show how queries, clicks and their associated perturbed counts can be published in a manner that rigorously preserves privacy. Our algorithm is decidedly simple to state, but non-trivial to analyze. On the opposite side of privacy is the question of whether the data we can safely publish is of any use. Our findings offer a glimmer of hope: we demonstrate that a non-negligible fraction of queries and clicks can indeed be safely published via a collection of experiments on a real search log. In addition, we select an application, keyword generation, and show that the keyword suggestions generated from the perturbed data resemble those generated from the original data.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1526709.1526733","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1526709.1526733","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser7b\/article\/4387902","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser7b\/article\/4387902","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1526709.1526733","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1526709.1526733[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser7b\/author\/Korolova:A","name":"Aleksandra Korolova"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser7b\/author\/Kenthapadi:K","name":"Krishnaram Kenthapadi"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser7b\/author\/Mishra:N","name":"Nina Mishra"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser7b\/author\/Ntoulas:A","name":"Alexandros Ntoulas"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web (2009), pp. 171-180, doi:10.1145\/1526709.1526733ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:4387902"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser7b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1526709.1526733","title":"Releasing search queries and clicks privately"}}}
