With today's online music services a music fan is never more than a few clicks away from being able to listen to nearly any song that has ever been recorded. Recommender systems can play a key role in this new music ecosystem, helping listeners explore, discover, organize and share music. However, in many ways music recommendation is very different than recommendation in other well-studied domains such as books and movies. In this talk we explore how recommender systems can be used in the music space, and the particular challenges that the music domain presents to the designers of recommender systems.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365994","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2365952.2365994","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/article\/11527868","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/article\/11527868","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F2365952.2365994","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F2365952.2365994[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/author\/Lamere:PB","name":"Paul B.
