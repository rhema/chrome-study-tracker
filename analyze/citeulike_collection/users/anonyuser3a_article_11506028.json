There are over a dozen different search services currently in existence, each with a unique interface and a database covering a different portion of the Web. As a result, users are forced to repeatedly try and retry their queries across different services. Furthermore, the services return many responses that are irrelevant, outdated, or unavailable, forcing the user to manually sift through the responses searching for useful information. This paper presents the MetaCrawler, a fielded Web service that represents the next level up in the information \"food chain.\" The MetaCrawler provides a single, central interface for Web document searching.
