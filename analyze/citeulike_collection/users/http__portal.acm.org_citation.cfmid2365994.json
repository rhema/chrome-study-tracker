With today's online music services a music fan is never more than a few clicks away from being able to listen to nearly any song that has ever been recorded. Recommender systems can play a key role in this new music ecosystem, helping listeners explore, discover, organize and share music. However, in many ways music recommendation is very different than recommendation in other well-studied domains such as books and movies. In this talk we explore how recommender systems can be used in the music space, and the particular challenges that the music domain presents to the designers of recommender systems.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365994&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365994&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365994"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"I've got 10 million songs in my pocket: now what?","text":"I've got 10 million songs in my pocket: now what?","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1662606683"}}}],"rich_media":{"mm_name":"rich_media","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2365994&ftid=1284763&dwn=1&CFID=196240317&CFTOKEN=18819485","title":"PDF full text"},"source":{"mm_name":"source","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/RecSys%20'12","year":"2012","title":"RecSys '12 Proceedings of the sixth ACM conference on Recommender systems           \n\t\t           tableￂﾠofￂﾠcontents","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Pￃﾡdraig Cunningham"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Ido Guy"}]},"articles":{"acm_portal":[{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365954&preflayout=flat","title":"Online controlled experiments: introduction, learnings, and humbling statistics"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365956&preflayout=flat","title":"Conducting user experiments in recommender systems"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365957&preflayout=flat","title":"Personality-based recommender systems: an overview"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365958&preflayout=flat","title":"Building industrial-scale real-world recommender systems"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365959&preflayout=flat","title":"The challenge of recommender systems challenges"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365961&preflayout=flat","title":"Multiple objective optimization in recommender systems"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365962&preflayout=flat","title":"Pareto-efficient hybridization for multi-objective recommender systems"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365963&preflayout=flat","title":"User effort vs. accuracy in rating-based elicitation"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365964&preflayout=flat","title":"TasteWeights: a visual interactive hybrid recommender system"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2365966&preflayout=flat","title":"Inspectability and control in social recommenders"}]}},"classifications":{"document":[{"mm_name":"classifications","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/ccs.cfm?CFID=196240317&CFTOKEN=18819485","title":"CCS rev.2012"},{"mm_name":"classifications","location":"http:\/\/www.acm.org\/class\/1998","title":"CCS rev.1998"},{"mm_name":"classifications","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/results.cfm?query=PrimaryCCS%3AH&querydisp=PrimaryCCS%3AH&termshow=matchboolean&CFID=196240317&CFTOKEN=18819485","title":"Information Systems"},{"mm_name":"classifications","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/results.cfm?query=PrimaryCCS%3AH3&querydisp=PrimaryCCS%3AH3&termshow=matchboolean&CFID=196240317&CFTOKEN=18819485","title":"INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL"},{"mm_name":"classifications","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/results.cfm?query=PrimaryCCS%3AH33&querydisp=PrimaryCCS%3AH33&termshow=matchboolean&CFID=196240317&CFTOKEN=18819485","title":"Information Search and Retrieval"},{"mm_name":"classifications","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/results.cfm?query=PrimarySubject%3A%22Information%20filtering%22&querydisp=PrimarySubject%3A%22Information%20filtering%22&termshow=matchboolean&CFID=196240317&CFTOKEN=18819485","title":"Information filtering"}]},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/results.cfm?query=%22information%20filtering%22&querydisp=%22information%20filtering%22&termshow=matchall&cfid=196240317&cftoken=18819485","title":"information filtering"},{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/results.cfm?query=%22music%22&querydisp=%22music%22&termshow=matchall&cfid=196240317&cftoken=18819485","title":"music"},{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/results.cfm?query=%22recommender%20systems%22&querydisp=%22recommender%20systems%22&termshow=matchall&cfid=196240317&cftoken=18819485","title":"recommender systems"}]}}}
