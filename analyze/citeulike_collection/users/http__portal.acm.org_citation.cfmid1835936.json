However, few publications systematically study how social actions evolve in a dynamic social network and to what extent different factors affect the user actions. In this paper, we propose a Noise Tolerant Time-varying Factor Graph Model (NTT-FGM) for modeling and predicting social actions. NTT-FGM simultaneously models social network structure, user attributes and user action history for better prediction of the users' future actions. More specifically, a user's action at time t is generated by her latent state at t, which is influenced by her attributes, her own latent state at time t-1 and her neighbors' states at time t and t-1. Based on this intuition, we formalize the social action tracking problem using the NTT-FGM model; then present an efficient algorithm to learn the model, by combining the ideas from both continuous linear system and Markov random field. Finally, we present a case study of our model on predicting future social actions. We validate the model on three different types of real-world data sets. Qualitatively, our model can uncover some interesting patterns of the social dynamics. Quantitatively, experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baseline methods for action prediction.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1835936&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1835936&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1835936"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Social action tracking via noise tolerant time-varying factor graphs","text":"Social action tracking via noise tolerant time-varying factor graphs","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1969832171"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81466642241","name":"Chenhao Tan","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1016137&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81350588685","name":"Jie Tang","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1016137&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81455605573","name":"Jimeng Sun","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1011639&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"IBM TJ Watson Research Center, New York City, USA"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81453643658","name":"Quan Lin","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1032593&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81423595464","name":"Fengjiao Wang","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1002626&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China"}]}}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","title":"R.
