Two types of actions, i.e., information provisioning and information evaluation, are common in such communities and are valuable in scoring each contribution. The EigenRumor algorithm, proposed here, calculates the contribution scores based on a link analysis approach by considering these actions as links from participants to information objects. The algorithm has similarities to Kleinberg's HITS algorithm in that both algorithms are based on the mutually reinforcing relationship of hubs and authorities but the EigenRumor model is not structured from page-to-page links but from participant-to-object links and is extended by the introduction of several new factors. The scores calculated by this algorithm can be used to identify \u201Cgood\u201D information and participants who contribute much to a community, which allows for the provisioning of incentives to such participants to promote their continuous contribution to the community.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2137729&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2137729"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"The eigenrumor algorithm for calculating contributions in cyberspace communities","text":"The eigenrumor algorithm for calculating contributions in cyberspace communities","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"427969341"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100086397&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0&cfid=196319304&cftoken=68985144","name":"Ko Fujimura","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1032250&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"NTT Cyber Solutions Laboratories and NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81474656932&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0&cfid=196319304&cftoken=68985144","name":"Naoto Tanimoto","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1032250&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"NTT Information Sharing Platform Laboratories and NTT Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"}]}}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=297827&preflayout=flat","title":"The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Sergey Brin"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Lawrence Page"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"1998","title":"Proceedings of the seventh international conference on World Wide Web 7, p.107-117, April 1998, Brisbane, Australia"}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=501175&preflayout=flat","title":"Computing and using reputations for internet ratings","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Mao Chen"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Jaswinder Pal Singh"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"2001","title":"Proceedings of the 3rd ACM conference on Electronic Commerce, p.154-162, October 14-17, 2001, Tampa, Florida, USA"}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=970709&preflayout=flat","title":"Chrysanthos Dellarocas, The Digitization of Word of Mouth: Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms, Management Science, v.49 n.10, p.1407-1424, October 2003"}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=352889&preflayout=flat","title":"Chrysanthos Dellarocas, Immunizing online reputation reporting systems against unfair ratings and discriminatory behavior, Proceedings of the 2nd ACM conference on Electronic commerce, p.150-157, October 17-20, 2000, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States"}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=564440&preflayout=flat","title":"PageRank","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Chris Ding"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Xiaofeng He"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Parry Husbands"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Hongyuan Zha"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Horst D.
