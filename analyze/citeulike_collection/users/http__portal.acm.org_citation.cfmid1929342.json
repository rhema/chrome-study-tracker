This paper presents a measurement study of 58M messages collected from 700K users on Twitter.com, a popular social medium. We analyze the propagation patterns of general messages and show how breaking news (Michael Jackson's death) spread through Twitter. Furthermore, we evaluate different social influences by examining their stabilities, assessments, and correlations. This paper addresses the complications as well as challenges we encounter when measuring message propagation and social influence on OSNs. We believe that our results here provide valuable insights for future OSN research.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1929342&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1929342&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1929342"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Measuring message propagation and social influence on Twitter.com","text":"Measuring message propagation and social influence on Twitter.com","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1888118974"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100042149","name":"Shaozhi Ye","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1025779&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81452594279","name":"S.
