(a) Full parallelization (b) Full serialization Figure 6.1: Two unrealistic scenarios for Web crawling: (a) parallelizing all page downloads and (b) serializing all page downloads. The areas represent page sizes, as size = speed time. Instead of downloading all pages in parallel, we could also serialize all the requests, downloading only one page at a time at the maximum speed, as depicted in Figure 6.1b. However, the bandwidth available for Web sites B i is usually lower than the crawler bandwidth B, so this scenario is not realistic either. The presented observations suggest that actual download time lines are similar to the one shown in Figure 6.2. In the Figure, the optimal time T is not achieved, because some bandwidth is wasted due to limitations in the speed of Web sites","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/summary?doi=10.1.1.1.2327","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/article\/11506031","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/article\/11506031"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/author\/Castillo:C","name":"Carlos Castillo"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/author\/Sp:B","name":"Bp Sp"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"(2004)ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11506031"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","title":"Scheduling Algorithms For Web Crawling"}}}
