To solve this problem at web-scale, keywords representing d's topics have to be combined to web queries. The retrieved web documents can then be delivered to a text reuse detection system for an in-depth analysis. We focus on the query formulation problem as the crucial first step in the detection process and present a new query formulation strategy that achieves convincing results: compared to a maximal termset query formulation strategy [10, 14], which is the most sensible non-heuristic baseline, we save on average 70% of the queries in realistic experiments. With respect to the candidate documents' quality, our heuristic retrieves documents that are, on average, more similar to the given document than the results of previously published query formulation strategies [4, 8].","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2051108&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2051108"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Candidate document retrieval for web-scale text reuse detection","text":"Candidate document retrieval for web-scale text reuse detection","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1024843243"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81330492209&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0&cfid=196319304&cftoken=68985144","name":"Matthias Hagen","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1028996&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Faculty of Media, Bauhaus-Universitￃﾤt Weimar, Germany"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81339530150&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0&cfid=196319304&cftoken=68985144","name":"Benno Stein","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1028996&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Faculty of Media, Bauhaus-Universitￃﾤt Weimar, Germany"}]}}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=672836&preflayout=flat","title":"Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Rakesh Agrawal"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Ramakrishnan Srikant"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"1994","title":"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, p.487-499, September 12-15, 1994"}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1411514&preflayout=flat","title":"Random sampling from a search engine's index","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Ziv Bar-Yossef"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Maxim Gurevich"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"2008","title":"Journal of the ACM (JACM), v.55 n.5, p.1-74, October 2008"}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=726264&preflayout=flat","title":"Using Noun Phrase Heads to Extract Document Keyphrases","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Ken Barker"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Nadia Cornacchia"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"2000","title":"Proceedings of the 13th Biennial Conference of the Canadian Society on Computational Studies of Intelligence: Advances in Artificial Intelligence, p.40-52, May 14-17, 2000"}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1498835&preflayout=flat","title":"Finding text reuse on the web","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Michael Bendersky"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"W.
