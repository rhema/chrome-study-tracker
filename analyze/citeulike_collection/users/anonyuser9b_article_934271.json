{"citeulike_paper":{"location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/934271","title":"Robust computer vision-based detection of pinching for one and two-handed gesture input","abstract":"We present a computer vision technique to detect when the user brings their thumb and forefinger together (a pinch gesture) for close-range and relatively controlled viewing circumstances. The technique avoids complex and fragile hand tracking algorithms by detecting the hole formed when the thumb and forefinger are touching; this hole is found by simple analysis of the connected components of the background segmented against the hand. Our Thumb and Fore-Finger Interface (TAFFI) demonstrates the technique for cursor control as well as map navigation using one and two-handed interactions.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1166292","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1166253.1166292","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/934271","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/934271","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1166253.1166292","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1166253.1166292[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Wilson:AD","name":"Andrew D.
