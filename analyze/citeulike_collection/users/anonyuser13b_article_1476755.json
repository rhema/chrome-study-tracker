While previous work has focused on one component of sentence significance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words), the methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmatic words (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentence location).The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology. The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of the above four components. The research methodology includes procedures for the compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the control parameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with manually produced extracts. The results indicate that the three newly proposed components dominate the frequency component in the production of better extracts.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=636680","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/321510.321519","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser13b\/article\/1476755","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser13b\/article\/1476755","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F321510.321519","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F321510.321519[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser13b\/author\/Edmundson:HP","name":"H.
