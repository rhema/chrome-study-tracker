There are two aspects to the key difficulties of this problem: one is that the meaning of the queries and the semantics of the predefined categories are hard to determine. The other is that there are no training data for this classification problem. We apply a two-phase framework to tackle the above difficulties. Phase I corresponds to the training phase of machine learning research and phase II corresponds to testing phase. In phase I, two kinds of classifiers are developed as the base classifiers. One is synonym-based and the other is statistics based. Phase II consists of two stages. In the first stage, the queries are enriched such that for each query, its related Web pages together with their category information are collected through the use of search engines. In the second stage, the enriched queries are classified through the base classifiers trained in phase I. Based on the classification results obtained by the base classifiers, two ensemble classifiers based on two different strategies are proposed. The experimental results on the validation dataset help confirm our conjectures on the performance of the Q2C@UST system. In addition, the evaluation results given by the KDDCUP 2005 organizer confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approaches. The best F1 value of our two solutions is 9.6% higher than the best of all other participants' solutions. The average F1 value of our two submitted solutions is 94.4% higher than the average F1 value from all other submitted solutions.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1117454.1117467","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1117454.1117467","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser13b\/article\/3433242","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser13b\/article\/3433242","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1117454.1117467","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1117454.1117467[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser13b\/author\/Shen:D","name":"Dou Shen"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser13b\/author\/Pan:R","name":"Rong Pan"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser13b\/author\/Sun:JT","name":"Jian T.
