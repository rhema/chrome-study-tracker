Our taxonomy must be regarded as an instrument to delineate targets for research and the realization of prototype applications that demonstrate the usefulness of agent-based intelligence on the Web. In addition, we deploy our agent-taxonomy to establish the implications particular target applications have with respect to software architecture and computational resources. 1. Introduction There is a lot of interest and work in the research and development of agent technology with applications on the Web. Many types of web agents have been proposed in recent years, which range from domain-dependent agents, like e-commerce agents, information gathering agents, to function-dependent agents, like negotiation agents, cooperating agents.
