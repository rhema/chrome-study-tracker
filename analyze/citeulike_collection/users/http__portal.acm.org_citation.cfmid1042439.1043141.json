This work uses customer demands derived from the frequent purchased products in each industry as valuable content information. Accordingly, this work explores two hybrid approaches each of which combines CF and customer demands to improve quality of recommendation. Valuable content information is also included as a factor in making recommendations for re-ranking candidate products. The experimental results indicate that the quality of recommendation obtained by the combined methods is promising.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1043141&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1043141&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1042439.1043141"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Hybrid Recommendation Approaches: Collaborative Filtering via Valuable Content Information","text":"Hybrid Recommendation Approaches: Collaborative Filtering via Valuable Content Information","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"761854369"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100194056","name":"Ya-Yueh Shih"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81452595950","name":"Duen-Ren Liu","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1015997&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"National Chiao Tung University"}]}}]},"citations":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"citations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1430194&preflayout=flat","title":"A Comparison of Different Rating Based Collaborative Filtering Algorithms","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Fabiￃﾡn P.
