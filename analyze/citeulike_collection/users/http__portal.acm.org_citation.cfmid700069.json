Now, Web crawling is being seriously considered as an important strategy for building large scale digital libraries. This paper covers some of the crawl technologies that might be exploited for collection building. For example, to make such collection-building crawls more effective, focused crawling was developed, in which the goal was to make a \"best-first\" crawl of the Web. We are using powerful crawler software to implement a focused crawl but use tunneling to overcome some of the limitations of a pure best-first approach. Tunneling has been described by others as not only prioritizing links from pages according to the page's relevance score, but also estimating the value of each link and prioritizing them as well. We add to this mix by devising a tunneling focused crawling strategy which evaluates the current crawl direction on the fly to determine when to terminate a tunneling activity. Results indicate that a combination of focused crawling and tunneling could be an effective tool for building digital libraries.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=700069&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=700069&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=700069"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Focused Crawls, Tunneling, and Digital Libraries","text":"Focused Crawls, Tunneling, and Digital Libraries","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1639604978"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100614132","name":"Donna Bergmark"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100645517","name":"Carl Lagoze"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100473762","name":"Alex Sbityakov"}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=544264&preflayout=flat","title":"Core services in the architecture of the national science digital library (NSDL)","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Carl Lagoze"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"William Arms"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Stoney Gan"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Diane Hillmann"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Christopher Ingram"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Dean Krafft"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Richard Marisa"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Jon Phipps"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"John Saylor"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Carol Terrizzi"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Walter Hoehn"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"David Millman"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"James Allan"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Sergio Guzman-Lara"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Tom Kalt"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"4264","title":"Proceedings of the 2nd ACM\/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries, July 14-18, 2002, Portland, Oregon, USA ￂﾠ[doi>10.1145\/544220.544264]"}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","title":"The NSF national science, technology","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Zia, L.L."}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"2001","title":"engineering, and mathematics education digital library (NSDL) program: New projects and a project report.
