We propose to exploit this variation in quality by learning a ranking function on bilingual queries: queries that appear in query logs for two languages but represent equivalent search interests. For a given bilingual query, along with corresponding monolingual query log and monolingual ranking, we generate a ranking on pairs of documents, one from each language. Then we learn a linear ranking function which exploits bilingual features on pairs of documents, as well as standard monolingual features. Finally, we show how to reconstruct monolingual ranking from a learned bilingual ranking. Using publicly available Chinese and English query logs, we demonstrate for both languages that our ranking technique exploiting bilingual data leads to significant improvements over a state-of-the-art monolingual ranking algorithm.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1690296","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/article\/11515553","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/article\/11515553"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/author\/Gao:W","name":"Wei Gao"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/author\/Blitzer:J","name":"John Blitzer"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/author\/Zhou:M","name":"Ming Zhou"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/author\/Wong:KF","name":"Kam F.
