The identification of these community structures has considerably attracted the attention of researchers in recent years. Thus, this paper reviews the main algorithms for finding communities and locating meaningful structures. The survey starts from graph theory and includes the latest algorithms for detecting web communities. The existence of communities that can overlap is also taken into account, as well as the main commonly used software tools for depicting communities.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1387210","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1504\/IJWBC.2008.019193","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/article\/11532060","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/article\/11532060","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1504%2FIJWBC.2008.019193","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1504%2FIJWBC.2008.019193[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Puig%26%2345%3bCentelles:A","name":"Anna Puig-Centelles"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Ripolles:O","name":"Oscar Ripolles"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Chover:M","name":"Miguel Chover"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"Int.
