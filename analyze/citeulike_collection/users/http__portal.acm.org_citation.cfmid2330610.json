The other student, whose background and learning needs appeared similar, scraped through the experience, has recently been eased out of her organization and is unemployed. To what extent were decisions taken by their tutors and institution about the design of their learning experiences, responsible for these two very different outcomes?","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2330610&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2330610&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2330610"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Learning analytics and higher education: ethical perspectives","text":"Learning analytics and higher education: ethical perspectives","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1625469227"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81503689618","name":"Sharon Slade","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1117492&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Open University, Boars Hills, Oxford, UK"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81503682566","name":"Fenella Galpin","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1117492&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Open University, Boars Hills, Oxford, UK"}]}}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","title":"McKinsey Global Institute. 2011.
