In order to rank the query results of web pages in an effective and efficient fashion, we propose a new page rank algorithm based on similarity measure from the vector space model, called SimRank, to score web pages. Firstly, we propose a new similarity measure to compute the similarity of pages and apply it to partition a web database into several web social networks (WSNs). Secondly, we improve the traditional PageRank algorithm by taking into account the relevance of page to a given query. Thirdly, we design an efficient web crawler to download the web data. And finally, we perform experimental studies to evaluate the time efficiency and scoring accuracy of SimRank with other approaches.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1109\/ISKE.2010.5680842"]},"rich_media":{"mm_name":"rich_media","location":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5680842","title":"PDF full text"},"source":{"mm_name":"source","location":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=5676709","title":"Intelligent Systems and Knowl"},"articles_by_authors":{"ieee_xplore_search":[{"mm_name":"articles_by_authors","location":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/search\/searchresult.jsp?searchWithin=p_Authors%3A.QT.Shaojie+Qiao.QT.","title":"Shaojie Qiao"},{"mm_name":"articles_by_authors","location":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/search\/searchresult.jsp?searchWithin=p_Authors%3A.QT.Tianrui+Li.QT.","title":"Tianrui Li"},{"mm_name":"articles_by_authors","location":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/search\/searchresult.jsp?searchWithin=p_Authors%3A.QT.Hong+Li.QT.","title":"Hong Li"},{"mm_name":"articles_by_authors","location":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/search\/searchresult.jsp?searchWithin=p_Authors%3A.QT.Yan+Zhu.QT.","title":"Yan Zhu"},{"mm_name":"articles_by_authors","location":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/search\/searchresult.jsp?searchWithin=p_Authors%3A.QT.Jing+Peng.QT.","title":"Jing Peng"},{"mm_name":"articles_by_authors","location":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/search\/searchresult.jsp?searchWithin=p_Authors%3A.QT.Jiangtao+Qiu.QT.","title":"Jiangtao Qiu"}]},"references_page":{"mm_name":"references_page","location":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/references.jsp?arnumber=5680842","ieee_xplore_id":"5680842","title":"SimRank: A Page Rank approach based on similarity measure"},"citations_page":{"mm_name":"citations_page","location":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/citations.jsp?arnumber=5680842","ieee_xplore_id":"5680842","title":"SimRank: A Page Rank approach based on similarity measure"}}}
