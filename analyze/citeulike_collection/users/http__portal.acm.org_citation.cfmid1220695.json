Typically, the error model relies on a weighted string edit distance measure. The weights can be learned from pairs of misspelled words and their corrections. This paper investigates using the Expectation Maximization algorithm to learn edit distance weights directly from search query logs, without relying on a corpus of paired words.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1220695&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1220695&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1220695"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Learning a spelling error model from search query logs","text":"Learning a spelling error model from search query logs","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"187838212"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81312484644","name":"Farooq Ahmad","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1025704&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100654689","name":"Grzegorz Kondrak","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1025704&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"}]}}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","title":"Baeza-Yates, R. 2005.
