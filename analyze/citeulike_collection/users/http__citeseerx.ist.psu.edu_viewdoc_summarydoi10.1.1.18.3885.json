An agent is viewed as a collection of com-  petence modules. Action selection is modeled as an emergent property  of an activation\/inhibition dynamics among these modules. A con-  crete action selection algorithm is presented and a detailed account of  the results is given. This algorithm combines characteristics of both  traditional planners and reactive systems: it produces fast and robust  activity in a tight interaction loop with the environment, while at the  same time allowing for some prediction and planning to take place. It  provides global parameters, which one can use to tune the action selection  behavior to the characteristics of the task environment. As such  one can smoothly trade off goal-orientedness for situation-orientedness,  bias towards ongoing plans (inertia) for adaptivity, thoughtfulness for  speed, and adjust its sensitivity to goal conflicts.","clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"How To Do the Right Thing","text":"How To Do the Right Thing","citeseerx_summary":{"simpl.ref":"1951737263"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Pattie Maes"}]},"references":[{"citeseerx_citing":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/showciting?cid=5215","title":"A robust layered control-system for a mobile robot\n                - Brooks\n                 - 1986"}},{"citeseerx_citing":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/showciting?cid=63263","title":"Pengi: An implementation of a theory of activity\n                - Agre, Chapman\n                 - 1987"}},{"citeseerx_citing":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/showciting?cid=154754","title":"A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice\n                - Simon\n                 - 1955"}},{"citeseerx_citing":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/showciting?cid=60931","title":"Reactive reasoning and planning\n                - Georgeff, Lansky\n                 - 1987"}},{"citeseerx_citing":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/showciting?cid=25048","title":"The Society of Mind.
