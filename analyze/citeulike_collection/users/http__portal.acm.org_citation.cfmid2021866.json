The size and complexity of these systems make them excellent platforms for the application of recommender systems, which can provide personalized views of complex information spaces. Many researchers have concentrated on the important problem of tag recommendation. Less attention has been paid to the recommendation of resources in the context of social annotation systems. In this paper, we examine the specific case of tag-based resource recommendation and propose a linear-weighted hybrid for the task. Using six real world datasets, we show that our algorithm is more effective than other more mathematically complex techniques.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2021866&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2021866&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2021866"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Tag-based resource recommendation in social annotation applications","text":"Tag-based resource recommendation in social annotation applications","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1329633628"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81384607852","name":"Jonathan Gemmell","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1029337&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Center for Web Intelligence, School of Computing, DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81444605909","name":"Thomas Schimoler","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1029337&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Center for Web Intelligence, School of Computing, DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100172561","name":"Bamshad Mobasher","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1029337&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Center for Web Intelligence, School of Computing, DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100241179","name":"Robin Burke","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1029337&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Center for Web Intelligence, School of Computing, DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois"}]}}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","title":"Automated tag clustering: Improving search and exploration in the tag space","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Begelman, G."},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Keller, P."},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Smadja, F."}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"2006","title":"In: Collaborative Web Tagging Workshop at WWW 2006, Edinburgh, Scotland (2006)."}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=586352&preflayout=flat","title":"Robin Burke, Hybrid Recommender Systems: Survey and Experiments, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, v.12 n.4, p.331-370, November 2002"}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=963776&preflayout=flat","title":"Item-based top-N recommendation algorithms","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Mukund Deshpande"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"George Karypis"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"2004","title":"ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), v.22 n.1, p.143-177, January 2004"}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1409544&preflayout=flat","title":"Constraint-based recommender systems: technologies and research issues","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"A.
