In this paper, we present a novel method for extracting from a Web object its \"hyper\" informative content, in contrast with current search engines, which only deal with the \"textual\" informative content. This method is not only valuable per se, but it is shown to be able to considerably increase the precision of current search engines, Moreover, it integrates smoothly with existing search engine technology since it can be implemented on top of every search engine, acting as a post-processor, thus automatically transforming a search engine into its corresponding \"hyper\" version. We also show how, interestingly, the hyper information can be usefully employed to face the search engine persuasion problem.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/summary?doi=10.1.1.59.3739","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/article\/11527838","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/article\/11527838"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/author\/Marchiori:M","name":"Massimo Marchiori"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In COMPUTER NETWORKS AND ISDN SYSTEMS (1997)ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11527838"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/tag\/exp","title":"exp"},{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/tag\/new","title":"new"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","title":"The quest for correct information on the web: Hyper search engines"}}}
