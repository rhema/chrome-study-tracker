Three years later, one student has gone on to gain a good degree and is now making great progress in her career. The other student, whose background and learning needs appeared similar, scraped through the experience, has recently been eased out of her organization and is unemployed. To what extent were decisions taken by their tutors and institution about the design of their learning experiences, responsible for these two very different outcomes?","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2330610","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2330601.2330610","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534132","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534132","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F2330601.2330610","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F2330601.2330610[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Slade:S","name":"Sharon Slade"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Galpin:F","name":"Fenella Galpin"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge (2012), pp. 16-17, doi:10.1145\/2330601.2330610ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11534132"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2330601.2330610","title":"Learning analytics and higher education: ethical perspectives"}}}
