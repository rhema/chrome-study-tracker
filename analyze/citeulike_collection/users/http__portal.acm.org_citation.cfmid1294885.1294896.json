In this article we propose a general IQ assessment framework. In contrast to context-specific IQ assessment models, which usually focus on a few variables determined by local needs, our framework consists of comprehensive typologies of IQ problems, related activities, and a taxonomy of IQ dimensions organized in a systematic way based on sound theories and practices. The framework can be used as a knowledge resource and as a guide for developing IQ measurement models for many different settings. The framework was validated and refined by developing specific IQ measurement models for two large-scale collections of two large classes of information objects: Simple Dublin Core records and online encyclopedia articles. ￂﾩ 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1294896&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1294896&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1294885.1294896"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"A framework for information quality assessment","text":"A framework for information quality assessment","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"303266590"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81350577251","name":"Besiki Stvilia","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1029675&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"College of Information, Florida State University, 269 Louis Shores Building, Tallahassee, FL, 32306, USA"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81309511694","name":"Les Gasser"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100388948","name":"Michael B.
