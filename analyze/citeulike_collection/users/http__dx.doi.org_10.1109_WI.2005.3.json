Such a model is appropriate when the links between pages are imprecise. The theoretical aspects of modeling the uncertainty associated with links are discussed. The advantages and limitations of the proposed methodology, which is based on the theory of fuzzy Markov chains, are described. Situations where fuzzy Web surfer models are appropriate compared to existing models are highlighted.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1109\/WI.2005.3"]},"rich_media":{"mm_name":"rich_media","location":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/stamp\/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1517829","title":"PDF full text"},"source":{"mm_name":"source","location":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10179","title":"Web Intelligence, 2005.
