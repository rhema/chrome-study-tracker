A large fraction of spam web pages is automatically generated, and some portion of these pages is generated by stitching together parts (sentences or paragraphs) of other web pages. This paper presents a scalable algorithm for detecting such \"quilted\" web pages. Previous work by the author and his collaborators introduced a sampling-based algorithm that was capable of detecting some, but by far not all quilted web pages in a collection. By contrast, the algorithm presented in this work identifies all quilted web pages, and it is scalable to very large corpora. We tested the algorithm on the half-billion page English-language subset of the ClueWeb09 collection, and evaluated its effectiveness in detecting web spam by manually inspecting small samples of the detected quilted pages. This manual inspection guided us in iteratively refining the algorithm to be more efficient in detecting real-world spam.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2348337&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2348337&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2348337"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Detecting quilted web pages at scale","text":"Detecting quilted web pages at scale","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"877249746"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100303448","name":"Marc Najork"}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","title":"Jacqueline Anderson, Reineke Reitsma, Patti F.
