Even though different methods have been proposed to exploit the link structure in identifying hubs and authorities in a set of linked documents, no existing approach can effectively deal with its changing situation. This paper explores changes in linked documents and proposes an incremental link probabilistic framework, which we call IPHITS. The model deals with online document streams in a faster, scalable way and uses a novel link updating technique that can cope with dynamic changes. Experimental results on two different sources of online information demonstrate the time saving strength of our method. Besides, we make analysis of the stable rankings under small perturbations to the linkage patterns.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1691532&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1691532&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1691532"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"IPHITS: An Incremental Latent Topic Model for Link Structure","text":"IPHITS: An Incremental Latent Topic Model for Link Structure","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1617129167"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81453645341","name":"Huifang Ma","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1032086&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 100190 and Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Bei ..."}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81453629373","name":"Weizhong Zhao","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1032086&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 100190 and Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Bei ..."}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81444594620","name":"Zhixin Li","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1032086&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 100190 and Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Bei ..."}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100646828","name":"Zhongzhi Shi","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1032086&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 100190 and Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Bei ..."}]}}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=290972&preflayout=flat","title":"Improved algorithms for topic distillation in a hyperlinked environment","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Krishna Bharat"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Monika R.
