An agent is viewed as a collection of com- petence modules. Action selection is modeled as an emergent property of an activation\/inhibition dynamics among these modules. A con- crete action selection algorithm is presented and a detailed account of the results is given. This algorithm combines characteristics of both traditional planners and reactive systems: it produces fast and robust activity in a tight interaction loop with the environment, while at the same time allowing for some prediction and planning to take place. It provides global parameters, which one can use to tune the action selection behavior to the characteristics of the task environment. As such one can smoothly trade off goal-orientedness for situation-orientedness, bias towards ongoing plans (inertia) for adaptivity, thoughtfulness for speed, and adjust its sensitivity to goal conflicts.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/summary?doi=10.1.1.18.3885","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser4b\/article\/4013142","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser4b\/article\/4013142"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser4b\/author\/Maes:P","name":"Pattie Maes"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"Connection Science Journal In Connection Science Journal, Vol. 1 (1989), pp. 291-323ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:4013142"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser4b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","title":"How To Do the Right Thing"}}}
