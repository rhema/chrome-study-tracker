In this paper, we present CHARM, an efficient algorithm for mining all frequent closed itemsets. It enumerates closed sets using a dual itemset-tidset search tree, using an efficient hybrid search that skips many levels. It also uses a technique called diffsets to reduce the memory footprint of intermediate computations. Finally, it uses a fast hash-based approach to remove any \"nonclosedￂ﾿ sets found during computation. We also present CHARM-L, an algorithm that outputs the closed itemset lattice, which is very useful for rule generation and visualization. An extensive experimental evaluation on a number of real and synthetic databases shows that CHARM is a state-of-the-art algorithm that outperforms previous methods. Further, CHARM-L explicitly generates the frequent closed itemset lattice.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1048864&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1048864&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1048864"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Efficient Algorithms for Mining Closed Itemsets and Their Lattice Structure","text":"Efficient Algorithms for Mining Closed Itemsets and Their Lattice Structure","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1109081616"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100229027","name":"Mohammed J.
