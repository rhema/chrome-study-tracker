As the size of the Web grows, it becomes imperative to parallelize a crawling process, in order to finish downloading pages in a reasonable amount of time. We first propose multiple architectures for a parallel crawler and identify fundamental issues related to parallel crawling. Based on this understanding, we then propose metrics to evaluate a parallel crawler, and compare the proposed architectures using 40 million pages collected from the Web. Our results clarify the relative merits of each architecture and provide a good guideline on when to adopt which architecture. 1","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/summary?doi=10.1.1.162.194","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser4b\/article\/11506320","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser4b\/article\/11506320"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser4b\/author\/Cho:J","name":"Junghoo Cho"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser4b\/author\/Garcia%2dmolina:H","name":"Hector Garcia-molina"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In In Proceedings of the 11th international conference on World Wide Web (2002), pp. 124-135ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11506320"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser4b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","title":"Parallel crawlers"}}}
