In particular, appropriately timed and clearly expressed emotion is a central requirement for believable characters. We discuss these ideas and suggest how they may apply to believable interactive characters, which we call \"believable agents.\" This work was supported in part by Fujitsu Laboratories and Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories.
