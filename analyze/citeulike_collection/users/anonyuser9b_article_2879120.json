{"citeulike_paper":{"location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/2879120","title":"PlayAnywhere: a compact interactive tabletop projection-vision system","abstract":"We introduce PlayAnywhere, a front-projected computer vision-based interactive table system which uses a new commercially available projection technology to obtain a compact, self-contained form factor. PlayAnywhere's configuration addresses installation, calibration, and portability issues that are typical of most vision-based table systems, and thereby is particularly motivated in consumer applications. PlayAnywhere also makes a number of contributions related to image processing techniques for front-projected vision-based table systems, including a shadow-based touch detection algorithm, a fast, simple visual bar code scheme tailored to projection-vision table systems, the ability to continuously track sheets of paper, and an optical flow-based algorithm for the manipulation of onscreen objects that does not rely on fragile tracking algorithms.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1095034.1095047","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1095034.1095047","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/2879120","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/2879120","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1095034.1095047","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1095034.1095047[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Wilson:AD","name":"Andrew D.
