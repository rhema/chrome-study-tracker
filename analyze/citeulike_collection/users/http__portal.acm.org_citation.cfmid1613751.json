We explore the use of Amazon's Mechanical Turk system, a significantly cheaper and faster method for collecting annotations from a broad base of paid non-expert contributors over the Web. We investigate five tasks: affect recognition, word similarity, recognizing textual entailment, event temporal ordering, and word sense disambiguation. For all five, we show high agreement between Mechanical Turk non-expert annotations and existing gold standard labels provided by expert labelers. For the task of affect recognition, we also show that using non-expert labels for training machine learning algorithms can be as effective as using gold standard annotations from experts. We propose a technique for bias correction that significantly improves annotation quality on two tasks. We conclude that many large labeling tasks can be effectively designed and carried out in this method at a fraction of the usual expense.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1613751&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1613751"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Cheap and fast---but is it good?: evaluating non-expert annotations for natural language tasks","text":"Cheap and fast---but is it good?: evaluating non-expert annotations for natural language tasks","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1946373435"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81323496340&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0&cfid=196319304&cftoken=68985144","name":"Rion Snow","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1030795&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Stanford University, Stanford, CA"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81442612329&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0&cfid=196319304&cftoken=68985144","name":"Brendan O'Connor"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100330420&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0&cfid=196319304&cftoken=68985144","name":"Daniel Jurafsky","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1030795&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Stanford University, Stanford, CA"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100471019&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0&cfid=196319304&cftoken=68985144","name":"Andrew Y.
