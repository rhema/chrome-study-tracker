Such a mix of positive and negative links\narise in a variety of online settings; we study datasets from Epinions,\nSlashdot and Wikipedia. We find that the signs of links in the underlying\nsocial networks can be predicted with high accuracy, using models that\ngeneralize across this diverse range of sites. These models provide insight\ninto some of the fundamental principles that drive the formation of signed\nlinks in networks, shedding light on theories of balance and status from social\npsychology; they also suggest social computing applications by which the\nattitude of one user toward another can be estimated from evidence provided by\ntheir relationships with other members of the surrounding social network. \n \n \n \n \n Subjects:","compound_document":{"simpl.ref":"13415589"}}},{"text_clipping":{"text":"\n Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph) ; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computers and Society (cs.CY)","compound_document":{"simpl.ref":"13415589"}}}]}}
