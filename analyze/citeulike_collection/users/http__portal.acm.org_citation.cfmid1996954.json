The means are longer queries that provide additional keywords. Readers who take this hypothesis for granted should recall the fact that virtually no user and none of the search index providers consider its implications. For readers who feel insecure about the claim, our paper gives empirical evidence.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1996954&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1996954"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Introducing the user-over-ranking hypothesis","text":"Introducing the user-over-ranking hypothesis","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"512220053"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81339530150&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0&cfid=196319304&cftoken=68985144","name":"Benno Stein","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1028996&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Bauhaus-Universitￃﾤt Weimar"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81330492209&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0&cfid=196319304&cftoken=68985144","name":"Matthias Hagen","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1028996&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Bauhaus-Universitￃﾤt Weimar"}]}}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1835545&preflayout=flat","title":"Exploring reductions for long web queries","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Niranjan Balasubramanian"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Giridhar Kumaran"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Vitor R.
