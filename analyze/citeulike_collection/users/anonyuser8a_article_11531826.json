Due to their brevity and idiosyncratic structure, search queries pose a challenge to existing NLP tools. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic approach for performing joint query annotation. First, we derive a robust set of unsupervised independent annotations, using queries and pseudo-relevance feedback. Then, we stack additional classifiers on the independent annotations, and exploit the dependencies between them to further improve the accuracy, even with a very limited amount of available training data. We evaluate our method using a range of queries extracted from a web search log. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach for both short keyword queries, and verbose natural language queries.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2002486","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8a\/article\/11531826","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8a\/article\/11531826"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8a\/author\/Bendersky:M","name":"Michael Bendersky"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8a\/author\/Croft:WB","name":"W.
