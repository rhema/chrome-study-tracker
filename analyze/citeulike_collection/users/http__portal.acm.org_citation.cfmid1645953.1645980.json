Simply applying the ranking model trained for the broad-based search to the verticals cannot achieve a sound performance due to the domain differences, while building different ranking models for each domain is both laborious for labeling sufficient training samples and time-consuming or the training process. In this paper, to address the above difficulties, we investigate two problems: (1) whether we can adapt the ranking model learned for existing Web page search or verticals, to the new domain, so that the amount of labeled data and the training cost is reduced, while the performance requirement is still satisfied; and (2) how to adapt the ranking model from auxiliary domains to a new target domain. We address the second problem from the regularization framework and an algorithm called ranking adaptation SVM is proposed. Our algorithm is flexible enough, which needs only the prediction from the existing ranking model, rather than the internal representation of the model or the data from auxiliary domains. The first problem is addressed by the proposed ranking adaptability measurement, which quantitatively estimates if an existing ranking model can be adapted to the new domain. Extensive experiments are performed over Letor benchmark dataset and two large scale datasets crawled from different domains through a commercial internet search engine, where the ranking model learned for one domain will be adapted to the other. The results demonstrate the applicabilities of the proposed ranking model adaptation algorithm and the ranking adaptability measurement.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1645980&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1645980&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1645953.1645980"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Ranking model adaptation for domain-specific search","text":"Ranking model adaptation for domain-specific search","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"445571171"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81384607903","name":"Bo Geng","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1018101&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Peking University, Beijing, China"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81335499805","name":"Linjun Yang"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81384602600","name":"Chao Xu","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1018101&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Peking University, Beijing, China"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100533893","name":"Xian-Sheng Hua"}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1610094&preflayout=flat","title":"Domain adaptation with structural correspondence learning","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"John Blitzer"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Ryan McDonald"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Fernando Pereira"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"2006","title":"Proceedings of the 2006 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, July 22-23, 2006, Sydney, Australia"}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1102363&preflayout=flat","title":"Learning to rank using gradient descent","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Chris Burges"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Tal Shaked"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Erin Renshaw"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Ari Lazier"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Matt Deeds"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Nicole Hamilton"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Greg Hullender"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"2363","title":"Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on Machine learning, p.89-96, August 07-11, 2005, Bonn, Germany ￂﾠ[doi>10.1145\/1102351.1102363]"}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","title":"C.
