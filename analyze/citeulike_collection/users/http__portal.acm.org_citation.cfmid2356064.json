This is performed by applying an Educational Data Mining (EDM) technology to former students curricula and their degree of success (GPA) and thus, uncovering golden didactic knowledge for successful education. We shifted strategy from an heagerh strategy of holding an explicit model towards a hlazyh strategy of mining with data, which is really available, holds empirically, and is not a result of hguessesh about the students' general characteristics. In particular, we utilize the educational history of the students and vocational ambitions for student modeling.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2356064&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2356064&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2356064"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"A Case Study on Using Data Mining for University Curricula","text":"A Case Study on Using Data Mining for University Curricula","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1424413988"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81508699866","name":"Yoshitaka Sakurai"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81508686555","name":"Kouhei Takada"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81508684631","name":"Setsuo Tsuruta"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100104962","name":"Rainer Knauf"}]},"rich_media":{"mm_name":"rich_media","title":"PDF full text"},"source":{"mm_name":"source","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/tableￂﾠofￂﾠcontents","year":"2012","title":"ICALT '12 Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies           \n\t\t           tableￂﾠofￂﾠcontents","articles":{"acm_portal":[{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2356042&preflayout=flat","title":"Cover Art"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2356043&preflayout=flat","title":"Title Page i"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2356044&preflayout=flat","title":"Title Page iii"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2356045&preflayout=flat","title":"Copyright Page"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2356062&preflayout=flat","title":"Preface"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2356027&preflayout=flat","title":"Reviewers"},{"mm_name":"articles","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2356063&preflayout=flat","title":"Principles for Collaborative Work","abstract":"Increasing complexity in our economy and society requires new approaches to work.
