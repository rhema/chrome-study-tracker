In this paper, we propose the Bayesian Browsing Model (BBM), a new modeling technique with following advantages: (a) it does exact inference; (b) it is single-pass and parallelizable; (c) it is effective. We present two sets of experiments to test model effectiveness and efficiency. On the first set of over 50 million search instances of 1.1 million distinct queries, BBM out-performs the state-of-the-art competitor by 29.2% in log-likelihood while being 57 times faster. On the second click-log set, spanning a quarter of petabyte data, we showcase the scalability of BBM: we implemented it on a commercial MapReduce cluster, and it took only 3 hours to compute the relevance for 1.15 billion distinct query-URL pairs.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1557019.1557081","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1557019.1557081","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/article\/5663331","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/article\/5663331","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1557019.1557081","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1557019.1557081[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/author\/Liu:C","name":"Chao Liu"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/author\/Guo:F","name":"Fan Guo"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/author\/Faloutsos:C","name":"Christos Faloutsos"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining (2009), pp. 537-546, doi:10.1145\/1557019.1557081ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:5663331"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1557019.1557081","title":"BBM: bayesian browsing model from petabyte-scale data"}}}
