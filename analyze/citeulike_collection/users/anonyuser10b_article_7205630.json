Several incidents have shown that simple removal of identifiers is insufficient to protect the identity of users. Publishing such inadequately anonymized data can cause severe breach of privacy. While significant effort has been expended on coming up with anonymity models and techniques for microdata, there is little corresponding work for query log data. Query logs are different in several important aspects, such as the diversity of queries and the causes of privacy breach. This necessitates the need to design privacy models and techniques specific to this environment. This paper takes a first cut at tackling this challenge. Our main contribution is to define effective anonymization models for query log data along with proposing techniques to achieve such anonymization. We analyze the inherent utility and privacy tradeoff, and experimentally validate the performance of our techniques.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1646146","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1645953.1646146","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/article\/7205630","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/article\/7205630","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1645953.1646146","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1645953.1646146[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/author\/Hong:Y","name":"Yuan Hong"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/author\/He:X","name":"Xiaoyun He"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/author\/Vaidya:J","name":"Jaideep Vaidya"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/author\/Adam:N","name":"Nabil Adam"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/author\/Atluri:V","name":"Vijayalakshmi Atluri"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Information and knowledge management (2009), pp. 1465-1468, doi:10.1145\/1645953.1646146ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:7205630"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1645953.1646146","title":"Effective anonymization of query logs"}}}
