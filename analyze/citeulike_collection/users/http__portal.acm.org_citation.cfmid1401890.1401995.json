Although some recently proposed methods can make meaningful query suggestions by mining query patterns from search logs, none of them are context-aware - they do not take into account the immediately preceding queries as context in query suggestion. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware query suggestion approach which is in two steps. In the offine model-learning step, to address data sparseness, queries are summarized into concepts by clustering a click-through bipartite. Then, from session data a concept sequence suffix tree is constructed as the query suggestion model. In the online query suggestion step, a user's search context is captured by mapping the query sequence submitted by the user to a sequence of concepts. By looking up the context in the concept sequence sufix tree, our approach suggests queries to the user in a context-aware manner. We test our approach on a large-scale search log of a commercial search engine containing 1:8 billion search queries, 2:6 billion clicks, and 840 million query sessions. The experimental results clearly show that our approach outperforms two baseline methods in both coverage and quality of suggestions.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1401995&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1401995&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1401890.1401995"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Context-aware query suggestion by mining click-through and session data","text":"Context-aware query suggestion by mining click-through and session data","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"690241577"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81351591834","name":"Huanhuan Cao","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1026437&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81452599802","name":"Daxin Jiang"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100323054","name":"Jian Pei","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1021190&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100331201","name":"Qi He","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1030350&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81361604208","name":"Zhen Liao","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1015879&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Nankai University, Tianjin, China"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81323488612","name":"Enhong Chen","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1026437&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81350598903","name":"Hang Li"}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","title":"Baeza-Yates, R.A., et al.
