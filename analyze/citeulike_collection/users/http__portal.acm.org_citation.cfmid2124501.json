In order to improve web search for a community of people with similar but specific interests, we propose to use the implicit knowledge contained in the search behavior of groups of users. We developed a multi-agent recommendation system called Implicit, which supports web search for groups or communities of people. In Implicit, agents observe behavior of their users to learn about the \"culture\" of the community with specific interests. They facilitate sharing of knowledge about relevant links within the community by means of recommendations. The agents also recommend contacts, i.e., who in the community is the right person to ask for a specific topic. Experimental evaluation shows that Implicit improves the quality of the web search in terms of precision and recall.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2124501&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2124501&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2124501"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Implicit: a multi-agent recommendation system for web search","text":"Implicit: a multi-agent recommendation system for web search","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1800712122"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81318487495","name":"Aliaksandr Birukou","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1032473&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"University of Trento, Trento, Italy"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100382391","name":"Enrico Blanzieri","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1032473&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"University of Trento, Trento, Italy"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100503511","name":"Paolo Giorgini","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1032473&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"University of Trento, Trento, Italy"}]}}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=672836&preflayout=flat","title":"Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Rakesh Agrawal"},{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Ramakrishnan Srikant"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"1994","title":"Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, p.487-499, September 12-15, 1994"}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=988728&preflayout=flat","title":"A community-aware search engine","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Rodrigo B.
