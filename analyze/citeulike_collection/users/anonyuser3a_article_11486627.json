However, search engines today focus on suggesting mainly reformulations and lexical variants of the query mined from query logs. In this demonstration, we show a system that can suggest related topics for a query based on the top search results for the query. It can help users in exploring the topics related to their information need. The topic suggestion system can be integrated with any search engine or it can be easily installed on the client machine as a browser plugin.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1835449.1835572","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/article\/11486627","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/article\/11486627","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1835449.1835572","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1835449.1835572[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/author\/Raju:S","name":"Santosh Raju"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/author\/Kumar:S","name":"Shaishav Kumar"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/author\/Udupa:R","name":"Raghavendra Udupa"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 33rd international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval (2010), doi:10.1145\/1835449.1835572ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11486627"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1835449.1835572","title":"Suggesting related topics in web search"}}}
