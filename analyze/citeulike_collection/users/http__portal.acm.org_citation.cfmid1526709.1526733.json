Since then a series of ad-hoc techniques have been proposed in the literature, though none are known to be provably private. In this paper, we take a major step towards a solution: we show how queries, clicks and their associated perturbed counts can be published in a manner that rigorously preserves privacy. Our algorithm is decidedly simple to state, but non-trivial to analyze. On the opposite side of privacy is the question of whether the data we can safely publish is of any use. Our findings offer a glimmer of hope: we demonstrate that a non-negligible fraction of queries and clicks can indeed be safely published via a collection of experiments on a real search log. In addition, we select an application, keyword generation, and show that the keyword suggestions generated from the perturbed data resemble those generated from the original data.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1526733&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1526733&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1526709.1526733"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Releasing search queries and clicks privately","text":"Releasing search queries and clicks privately","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1656041484"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100489527","name":"Aleksandra Korolova","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1030795&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81342500095","name":"Krishnaram Kenthapadi"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81332516120","name":"Nina Mishra"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100333035","name":"Alexandros Ntoulas"}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","title":"E.
