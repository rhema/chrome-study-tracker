PlayAnywhere's configuration addresses installation, calibration, and portability issues that are typical of most vision-based table systems, and thereby is particularly motivated in consumer applications. PlayAnywhere also makes a number of contributions related to image processing techniques for front-projected vision-based table systems, including a shadow-based touch detection algorithm, a fast, simple visual bar code scheme tailored to projection-vision table systems, the ability to continuously track sheets of paper, and an optical flow-based algorithm for the manipulation of onscreen objects that does not rely on fragile tracking algorithms.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1095047&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1095034.1095047"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"PlayAnywhere: a compact interactive tabletop projection-vision system","text":"PlayAnywhere: a compact interactive tabletop projection-vision system","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1745892846"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81350567780&coll=DL&dl=ACM&trk=0&cfid=196319304&cftoken=68985144","name":"Andrew D.
