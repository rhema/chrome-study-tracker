Flink employs semantic technology for reasoning with personal information extracted from a number of electronic information sources including web pages, emails, publication archives and FOAF profiles. The acquired knowledge is used for the purposes of social network analysis and for generating a web-based presentation of the community. We demonstrate our novel method to social science based on electronic data using the example of the Semantic Web research community.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.websem.2005.05.006"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.scopus.com\/authid\/detail.url?authorId=6603074009","scopus_author_id":"6603074009","name":"Peter Mika"}]},"references":[{"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"references","title":"Linked: The New Science of Networks","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"A.L.
