Therefore it is essential to develop effective crawling strategies to prioritize the pages to be indexed. The issue is even more important for topic-specific search engines, where crawlers must make additional decisions based on the relevance of visited pages. However, it is difficult to evaluate alternative crawling strategies because relevant sets are unknown and the search space is changing. We propose three different methods to evaluate crawling strategies. We apply the proposed metrics to compare three topic-driven crawling algorithms based on similarity ranking, link analysis, and adaptive agents.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=383995","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/383952.383995","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/article\/11531963","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/article\/11531963","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F383952.383995","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F383952.383995[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Menczer:F","name":"Filippo Menczer"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Pant:G","name":"Gautam Pant"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Srinivasan:P","name":"Padmini Srinivasan"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Ruiz:ME","name":"Miguel E.
