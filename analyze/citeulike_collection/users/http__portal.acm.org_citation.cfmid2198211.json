A review of 10 years of research on log analysis is presented in this paper. About 50 papers and posters from five major conferences and about 30 related journal papers have been selected to trace the history of the state-of-the-art in this field. The paper presents an overview of two main themes: Web search engine log analysis and Digital Library System log analysis. The problem of the analysis of different sources of log data and the distribution of data are investigated.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2198211&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2198211&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2198211"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Web log analysis: a review of a decade of studies about information acquisition, inspection and interpretation of user interaction","text":"Web log analysis: a review of a decade of studies about information acquisition, inspection and interpretation of user interaction","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1265172315"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100235299","name":"Maristella Agosti","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1031996&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua, Padova, Italy 35131"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100046867","name":"Franco Crivellari","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1031996&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua, Padova, Italy 35131"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81350604841","name":"Giorgio Maria Di Nunzio","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1031996&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua, Padova, Italy 35131"}]}}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1324841&preflayout=flat","title":"Maristella Agosti, Information Access through Search Engines and Digital Libraries (The Information Retrieval Series), Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., Secaucus, NJ, 2007"}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","title":"Agosti M (2008b) Log data in digital libraries.
