In this paper, we present CHARM, an efficient algorithm for mining all frequent closed itemsets. It enumerates closed sets using a dual itemset-tidset search tree, using an efficient hybrid search that skips many levels. It also uses a technique called diffsets to reduce the memory footprint of intermediate computations. Finally, it uses a fast hash-based approach to remove any \"nonclosedￃﾂￂ﾿ sets found during computation. We also present CHARM-L, an algorithm that outputs the closed itemset lattice, which is very useful for rule generation and visualization. An extensive experimental evaluation on a number of real and synthetic databases shows that CHARM is a state-of-the-art algorithm that outperforms previous methods. Further, CHARM-L explicitly generates the frequent closed itemset lattice.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1048864","http:\/\/doi.ieeecomputersociety.org\/10.1109\/TKDE.2005.60","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1109\/TKDE.2005.60","http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpls\/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1401887","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/article\/769773","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/article\/769773","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1109%2FTKDE.2005.60","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1109%2FTKDE.2005.60[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/author\/Zaki:MJ","name":"Mohammed J.
