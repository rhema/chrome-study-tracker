In this sense, our main goal is to investigate the power of retweet mechanism. The findings suggest that relations of \"friendship\" at Twitter are important but not enough. Still, the centrality measures of a node importance do not show how important users are. We uncovered some other principles that must be studied like, homophily phenomenon, the tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2254145","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2254129.2254145","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/article\/10802181","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/article\/10802181","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F2254129.2254145","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F2254129.2254145[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Weitzel:L","name":"Leila Weitzel"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Quaresma:P","name":"Paulo Quaresma"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Jos%7b%c3%a9%7d+Palazzo","name":"Josￃﾩ Palazzo"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics (2012), doi:10.1145\/2254129.2254145ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:10802181"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2254129.2254145","title":"Measuring node importance on Twitter microblogging"}}}
