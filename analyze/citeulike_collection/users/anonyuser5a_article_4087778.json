Web search cases which involve underspecification of information needs at the beginning and modification of search strategies during the search process will be collected and examined by human analysts. The study focuses on identifying the rules used by analysts to infer searcher interests. These rules can be put into algorithms as the basis for systems that provide query modification suggestions or implicitly reformulate the query as the searcher continues to work.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1297231.1297272","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1297231.1297272","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/article\/4087778","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/article\/4087778","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1297231.1297272","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1297231.1297272[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/author\/Fu:X","name":"Xin Fu"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 2007 ACM conference on Recommender systems (2007), pp. 191-194, doi:10.1145\/1297231.1297272ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:4087778"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1297231.1297272","title":"Evaluating sources of implicit feedback in web searches"}}}
