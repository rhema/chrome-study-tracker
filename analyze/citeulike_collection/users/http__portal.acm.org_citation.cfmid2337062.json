However, these data, while rich in content, are usually sparse in textual descriptive information. For example, a video clip is often associated with only a few tags. Moreover, the textual descriptions are often overly specific to the video content. Such characteristics make it very challenging to discover topics at a satisfactory granularity on this kind of data. In this paper, we propose a generative probabilistic model named Preference-Topic Model (PTM) to introduce the dimension of user preferences to enhance the insufficient textual information. PTM is a unified framework to combine the tasks of user preference discovery and document topic mining together. Through modeling user-document interactions, PTM cannot only discover topics and preferences simultaneously, but also enable them to inform and benefit each other in a unified framework. As a result, PTM can extract better topics and preferences from sparse data. The experimental results on real-life video application data show that PTM is superior to LDA in discovering informative topics and preferences in terms of clustering-based evaluations. Furthermore, the experimental results on DBLP data demonstrate that PTM is a general model which can be applied to other kinds of user-document interactions.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2337062&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2337062&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2337062"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"A probabilistic graphical model for topic and preference discovery on social media","text":"A probabilistic graphical model for topic and preference discovery on social media","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"129597779"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81503683033","name":"Lu Liu"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81313483490","name":"Feida Zhu","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1021215&CFID=196240317&CFTOKEN=18819485","title":"Singapore Management University, Singapore"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81503683119","name":"Lei Zhang"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81503689870","name":"Shiqiang Yang","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1016137&CFID=196240317&CFTOKEN=18819485","title":"Tsinghua University, China"}]}}]},"references":[{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=312649&preflayout=flat","title":"Probabilistic latent semantic indexing","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"Thomas Hofmann"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","year":"2649","title":"Proceedings of the 22nd annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval, p.50-57, August 15-19, 1999, Berkeley, California, United States ￂﾠ[doi>10.1145\/312624.312649]"}}},{"acm_portal":{"mm_name":"references","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=944937&preflayout=flat","title":"Latent dirichlet allocation","authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","name":"David M.
