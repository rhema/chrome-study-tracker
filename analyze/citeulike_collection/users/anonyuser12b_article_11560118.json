By considering both in- and out-link relationships, we propose Additive- and Multiplicative-SimRank to calculate the similarity score. Then we discuss the loop\/cycles problem of information networks and propose a method to address this problem. Our extensive experimental results conducted on eight food web data sets show that our approach performs significantly better than earlier approaches.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2033649","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12b\/article\/11560118","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12b\/article\/11560118"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12b\/author\/Cai:Y","name":"Yuanzhe Cai"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12b\/author\/Chakravarthy:S","name":"Sharma Chakravarthy"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 13th international conference on Data warehousing and knowledge discovery (2011), pp. 316-329ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11560118"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","title":"Pairwise similarity calculation of information networks"}}}
