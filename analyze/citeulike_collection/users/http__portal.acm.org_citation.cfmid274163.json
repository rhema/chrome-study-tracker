In\nparticular, we examine large-sample approximations for the marginal\nlikelihood of naive-Bayes models in which the root node is hidden.\nSuch models are useful for clustering or unsupervised learning. We\nconsider a Laplace approximation and the less accurate but more\ncomputationally efficient approximation known as the Bayesian\nInformation Criterion (BIC), which is equivalent to Rissanen\u2018s\n(1987) Minimum Description Length (MDL). Also, we\nconsider approximations that ignore some off-diagonal elements of the\nobserved information matrix and an approximation proposed by Cheeseman\nand Stutz (1995). We evaluate the accuracy of these\napproximations using a Monte-Carlo gold standard. In experiments with\nartificial and real examples, we find that (1) none of the\napproximations are accurate when used for model averaging, (2) all of\nthe approximations, with the exception of BIC\/MDL, are accurate for\nmodel selection, (3) among the accurate approximations, the\nCheeseman\u2013Stutz and Diagonal approximations are the most\ncomputationally efficient, (4) all of the approximations, with the\nexception of BIC\/MDL, can be sensitive to the prior distribution over\nmodel parameters, and (5) the Cheeseman\u2013Stutz approximation can be\nmore accurate than the other approximations, including the Laplace\napproximation, in situations where the parameters in the maximum a\nposteriori configuration are near a boundary.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=274163&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=274163&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=274163"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Efficient Approximations for the MarginalLikelihood of Bayesian Networks with Hidden Variables","text":"Efficient Approximations for the MarginalLikelihood of Bayesian Networks with Hidden Variables","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"960322088"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100277962","name":"David Maxwell Chickering","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1015014&CFID=196240317&CFTOKEN=18819485","title":"Microsoft Research Redmond WA 98052-6399.
