Unlike conventional hashing, extendible hashing has a dynamic structure that grows and shrinks gracefully as the database grows and shrinks. This approach simultaneously solves the problem of making hash tables that are extendible and of making radix search trees that are balanced. We study, by analysis and simulation, the performance of extendible hashing. The results indicate that extendible hashing provides an attractive alternative to other access methods, such as balanced trees.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=320092&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=320092&preflayout=flat","http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=320092"]},"clippings":[{"text_clipping":{"context":"Extendible hashing\u2014a fast access method for dynamic files","text":"Extendible hashing\u2014a fast access method for dynamic files","acm_portal":{"simpl.ref":"1928953768"}}}],"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100578906","name":"Ronald Fagin","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1011639&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"IBM Research Lab, San Jose, CA"}]}},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81410593611","name":"Jurg Nievergelt"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/author_page.cfm?id=81100564606","name":"Nicholas Pippenger","affiliations":{"acm_portal_institution_profile":[{"mm_name":"affiliations","location":"http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/inst_page.cfm?id=1011639&CFID=196319304&CFTOKEN=68985144","title":"IBM T.
