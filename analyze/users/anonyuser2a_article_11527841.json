We apply the graph-ranking algorithm using the accurate labels of old-domain documents as well as the \"pseudo\" labels of new-domain documents. Experimental results show that proposed algorithm could improve the performance of baseline methods dramatically for sentiment transfer.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1667681","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/article\/11527841","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/article\/11527841"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/author\/Wu:Q","name":"Qiong Wu"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/author\/Tan:S","name":"Songbo Tan"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/author\/Cheng:X","name":"Xueqi Cheng"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the ACL-IJCNLP 2009 Conference Short Papers (2009)ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11527841"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/tag\/exp","title":"exp"},{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/tag\/new","title":"new"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","title":"Graph ranking for sentiment transfer"}}}
