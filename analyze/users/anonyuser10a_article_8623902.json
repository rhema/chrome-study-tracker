However, few publications systematically study how social actions evolve in a dynamic social network and to what extent different factors affect the user actions. In this paper, we propose a Noise Tolerant Time-varying Factor Graph Model (NTT-FGM) for modeling and predicting social actions. NTT-FGM simultaneously models social network structure, user attributes and user action history for better prediction of the users' future actions. More specifically, a user's action at time t is generated by her latent state at t, which is influenced by her attributes, her own latent state at time t-1 and her neighbors' states at time t and t-1. Based on this intuition, we formalize the social action tracking problem using the NTT-FGM model; then present an efficient algorithm to learn the model, by combining the ideas from both continuous linear system and Markov random field. Finally, we present a case study of our model on predicting future social actions. We validate the model on three different types of real-world data sets. Qualitatively, our model can uncover some interesting patterns of the social dynamics. Quantitatively, experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baseline methods for action prediction.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1835936","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1835804.1835936","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/article\/8623902","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/article\/8623902","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1835804.1835936","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1835804.1835936[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Tan:C","name":"Chenhao Tan"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Tang:J","name":"Jie Tang"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Sun:J","name":"Jimeng Sun"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Lin:Q","name":"Quan Lin"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Wang:F","name":"Fengjiao Wang"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining (2010), pp. 1049-1058, doi:10.1145\/1835804.1835936ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:8623902"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1835804.1835936","title":"Social action tracking via noise tolerant time-varying factor graphs"}}}
