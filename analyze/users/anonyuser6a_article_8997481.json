This is because they measure user similarity only from the co-rating behaviors against items and compute recommendations by analyzing the items possessed by the users most similar to the active user. In this paper, we define item novelty as the smallest distance from the class the user accessed before to the class that includes target items over the taxonomy. Then, we try to accurately recommend highly novel items to the user. First, our method measures user similarity by employing items rated by users and a taxonomy of items. It can accurately identify many items that may suit the user. Second, it creates a graph whose nodes are users; weighted edges are set between users according to their similarity. It analyzes the user graph and extracts users that are related on the graph though the similarity between the active user and each of those users is not high. The users so extracted are likely to have highly novel items for the active user. An evaluation conducted on several datasets finds that our method accurately identifies items with higher novelty than previous methods.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1871558","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1871437.1871558","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6a\/article\/8997481","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6a\/article\/8997481","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1871437.1871558","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1871437.1871558[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6a\/author\/Nakatsuji:M","name":"Makoto Nakatsuji"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6a\/author\/Fujiwara:Y","name":"Yasuhiro Fujiwara"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6a\/author\/Tanaka:A","name":"Akimichi Tanaka"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6a\/author\/Uchiyama:T","name":"Toshio Uchiyama"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6a\/author\/Fujimura:K","name":"Ko Fujimura"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6a\/author\/Ishida:T","name":"Toru Ishida"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management (2010), pp. 949-958, doi:10.1145\/1871437.1871558ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:8997481"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6a\/tag\/novelty","title":"novelty"},{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6a\/tag\/recommendation","title":"recommendation"},{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6a\/tag\/twitter","title":"twitter"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1871437.1871558","title":"Classical music for rock fans?: novel recommendations for expanding user interests"}}}
