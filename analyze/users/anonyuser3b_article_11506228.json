{"citeulike_paper":{"location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/article\/11506228","title":"A comparative evaluation of personality estimation algorithms for the twin recommender system","abstract":"The appearance of the so-called recommender systems has led to the possibility of reducing the information overload experienced by individuals searching among online resources. One of the areas of application of recommender systems is the online tourism domain where sites like TripAdvisor allow people to post reviews of various hotels to help others make a good choice when planning their trip. As the number of such reviews grows in size every day, clearly it is impractical for the individual to go through all of them. We propose the TWIN (\"Tell me What I Need\") Personality-based Recommender System that analyzes the textual content of the reviews and estimates the personality of the user according to the Big Five model to suggest the reviews written by \"twin-minded\" people. In this paper we compare a number of algorithms to select the better option for personality estimation in the task of user profile construction.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2065028","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2065023.2065028","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/article\/11506228","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/article\/11506228","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F2065023.2065028","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F2065023.2065028[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/author\/Roshchina:A","name":"Alexandra Roshchina"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/author\/Cardiff:J","name":"John Cardiff"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/author\/Rosso:P","name":"Paolo Rosso"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on Search and mining user-generated contents (2011), pp. 11-18, doi:10.1145\/2065023.2065028ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11506228"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2065023.2065028","title":"A comparative evaluation of personality estimation algorithms for the twin recommender system"}}}
