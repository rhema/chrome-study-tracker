{"citeulike_paper":{"location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/3346772","title":"A user-adaptive city guide system with an unobtrusive navigation interface","abstract":"In this paper, we describe an intelligent location-aware city guide system, which adapts to each user's preferences, and uses an intuitive \"metal detector\" interface for navigation. Our system analyzes each user's past location data history to estimate individual preferences, and allows users to find shops that match their tastes in the same way a metal detector would be used to detect metal objects. The procedure with which the system picks out shops that match each user's preferences includes a newly developed place learning algorithm, which can efficiently find frequented places, complete with their proper names (e.g. \"The Ueno Royal Museum\"). We have conducted a series of evaluation tests at a popular shopping district inside Tokyo, and the results validate the effectiveness of our overall approach.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1487487","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00779-007-0192-x","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/3346772","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/3346772","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1007%2Fs00779-007-0192-x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1007%2Fs00779-007-0192-x[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Takeuchi:Y","name":"Yuichiro Takeuchi"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Sugimoto:M","name":"Masanori Sugimoto"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"Personal Ubiquitous Comput., Vol. 13, No. 2.
