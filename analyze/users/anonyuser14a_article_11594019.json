Major Web Search Engines usually provide \"Suggestions\" under the form of queries that are, to some extent, related to the current query typed by the user, and the knowledge learned from the past usage of the system. In this work we introduce \"Search Shortcuts\" as \"Successful\" queries allowed, in the past, users to satisfy their information needs. Differently from conventional suggestion techniques, our search shortcuts allows to evaluate effectiveness by exploiting a simple train-and-test approach. We have applied several Collaborative Filtering algorithms to this problem, evaluating them on a real query log data. We generate the shortcuts from all user sessions belonging to the testing set, and measure the quality of the shortcuts suggested by considering the similarity between them and the navigational user behavior.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1526862","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1526709.1526862","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/article\/11594019","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/article\/11594019","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1526709.1526862","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1526709.1526862[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/author\/Baraglia:R","name":"Ranieri Baraglia"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/author\/Cacheda:F","name":"Fidel Cacheda"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/author\/Carneiro:V","name":"Victor Carneiro"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/author\/Formoso:V","name":"Vreixo Formoso"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/author\/Perego:R","name":"Raffaele Perego"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/author\/Silvestri:F","name":"Fabrizio Silvestri"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 18th international conference on World wide web (2009), pp. 1073-1074, doi:10.1145\/1526709.1526862ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11594019"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1526709.1526862","title":"Search shortcuts: driving users towards their goals"}}}
