This problem is at the heart of Mining Name Transliterations (MINT) from various sources of multilingual text data including parallel, comparable, and non-comparable corpora and multilingual news streams. MINT is useful in several cross-language tasks including Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), Machine Translation (MT), and Cross-Language Named Entity Retrieval. We propose a novel approach to Transliteration Equivalence using language-neutral representations of names. The key idea is to consider name transliterations in two languages as two views of the same semantic object and compute a low-dimensional common feature space using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Similarity of the names in the common feature space forms the basis for classifying a pair of names as transliterations. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in the CLIR task for Hindi-English (3 collections) and Tamil-English (2 collections).","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2128344.2128357","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/978-3-642-12275-0_10","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser13b\/article\/11560119","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser13b\/article\/11560119","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1007%2F978-3-642-12275-0_10","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1007%2F978-3-642-12275-0_10[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser13b\/author\/Udupa:R","name":"Raghavendra Udupa"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser13b\/author\/Khapra:MM","name":"Mitesh M.
