This paper presents our research on the development of a dashboard that enables self-reflection on activities and comparison with peers. We describe evaluation results of four iterations of a design based research methodology that assess the usability, use and usefulness of different visualizations. Lessons learned from the different evaluations performed during each iteration are described. In addition, these evaluations illustrate that the dashboard is a useful tool for students. However, further research is needed to assess the impact on the learning process.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2330639","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2330601.2330639","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534136","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534136","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F2330601.2330639","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F2330601.2330639[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Santos:JL","name":"Jose L.
