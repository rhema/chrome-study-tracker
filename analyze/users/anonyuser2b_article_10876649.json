However, these data, while rich in content, are usually sparse in textual descriptive information. For example, a video clip is often associated with only a few tags. Moreover, the textual descriptions are often overly specific to the video content. Such characteristics make it very challenging to discover topics at a satisfactory granularity on this kind of data. In this paper, we propose a generative probabilistic model named Preference-Topic Model (PTM) to introduce the dimension of user preferences to enhance the insufficient textual information. PTM is a unified framework to combine the tasks of user preference discovery and document topic mining together. Through modeling user-document interactions, PTM cannot only discover topics and preferences simultaneously, but also enable them to inform and benefit each other in a unified framework. As a result, PTM can extract better topics and preferences from sparse data. The experimental results on real-life video application data show that PTM is superior to LDA in discovering informative topics and preferences in terms of clustering-based evaluations. Furthermore, the experimental results on DBLP data demonstrate that PTM is a general model which can be applied to other kinds of user-document interactions.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2337062","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neucom.2011.05.039","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/article\/10876649","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/article\/10876649","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1016%2Fj.neucom.2011.05.039","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1016%2Fj.neucom.2011.05.039[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/author\/Liu:L","name":"Lu Liu"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/author\/Zhu:F","name":"Feida Zhu"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/author\/Zhang:L","name":"Lei Zhang"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/author\/Yang:S","name":"Shiqiang Yang"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"Neurocomput., Vol. 95 (October 2012), pp. 78-88, doi:10.1016\/j.neucom.2011.05.039ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:10876649"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neucom.2011.05.039","title":"A probabilistic graphical model for topic and preference discovery on social media"}}}
