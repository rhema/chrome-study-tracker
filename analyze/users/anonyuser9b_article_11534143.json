Thanks to these technologies, we can experience a virtual real sound environment. However, there are other types of sound technologies that enhance reality, such as acoustic filters, sound effects, and background music. They are quite effective if carefully prepared, but they also alter the sound itself. Consequently, sound is simultaneously used to reconstruct realistic environments and to enhance emotions, which are actually incompatible functions. With this background, we focused on using tactile modality to enhance emotions and propose a method that enhances the sound experience by a combination of sound and skin sensation to the pinna (earlobe). In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of this method.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1866248","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1866218.1866248","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534143","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534143","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1866218.1866248","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1866218.1866248[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Aou:K","name":"Kanako Aou"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Ishii:A","name":"Asuka Ishii"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Furukawa:M","name":"Masahiro Furukawa"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Fukushima:S","name":"Shogo Fukushima"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Kajimoto:H","name":"Hiroyuki Kajimoto"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Adjunct proceedings of the 23nd annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology (2010), pp. 415-416, doi:10.1145\/1866218.1866248ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11534143"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1866218.1866248","title":"The enhancement of hearing using a combination of sound and skin sensation to the pinna"}}}
