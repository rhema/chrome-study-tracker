Often times, this amounts to a user seeking answers to a question. However, queries, which encode user's information need, are typically not expressed as full-length natural language sentences --- in particular, as questions. Rather, they consist of one or more text fragments. As humans become more search-engine-savvy, do natural-language questions still have a role to play in web search? Through a systematic, large-scale study, we find to our surprise that as time goes by, web users are more likely to use questions to express their search intent.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2002766","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/article\/11515474","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/article\/11515474"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/author\/Pang:B","name":"Bo Pang"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/author\/Kumar:R","name":"Ravi Kumar"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies: short papers - Volume 2 (2011), pp. 135-140ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11515474"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser5a\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","title":"Search in the lost sense of \"query\": question formulation in web search queries and its temporal changes"}}}
