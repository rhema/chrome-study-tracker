WebSQL takes advantage of multiple index servers without requiring users to know about them, and integrates full-text with topology-based queries. The WebSQL query engine is a library of Java classes, and WebSQL queries can be embedded into Java programs much in the same way as SQL queries are embedded in C programs. This allows us to access the Web from Java at a much higher level of abstraction than bare HTTP requests. We illustrate the use of WebSQL for application development by describing two applications we are experimenting with: Web site maintenance and specialized index construction. We also sketch several other possible applications. Using the library, we have also implemented a client-server architecture that allows us to perform interactive intelligent searches on the Web from an applet running on a browser. 1 Introduction Developing data...","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/summary?doi=10.1.1.12.678","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/article\/11506073","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/article\/11506073"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/author\/Arocena:G","name":"Gustavo Arocena"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/author\/Mendelzon:AO","name":"Alberto O.
