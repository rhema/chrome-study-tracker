In this paper, we present the quality-biased ranking method that promotes documents containing high-quality content, and penalizes low-quality documents. The quality of the document content can be determined by its readability, layout and ease-of-navigation, among other factors. Accordingly, instead of using a single estimate for document quality, we consider multiple content-based features that are directly integrated into a state-of- the-art retrieval method. These content-based features are easy to compute, store and retrieve, even for large web collections. We use several query sets and web collections to empirically evaluate the performance of our quality-biased retrieval method. In each case, our method consistently improves by a large margin the retrieval performance of text-based and link-based retrieval methods that do not take into account the quality of the document content.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1935849","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1935826.1935849","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6b\/article\/10020454","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6b\/article\/10020454","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1935826.1935849","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1935826.1935849[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6b\/author\/Bendersky:M","name":"Michael Bendersky"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser6b\/author\/Croft:WB","name":"W.
