Yet it still remains a challenge for existing strategies to deal with dynamically-evolving networks that contain community structures, though they are ubiquitous in the real world. In this paper, we examine the performances of an autonomy-oriented distributed search strategy for tackling such networks. The strategy is based on the ideas of self-organization and positive feedback from Autonomy-Oriented Computing (AOC). Our experimental results have shown that autonomous entities in this strategy can collectively find and immunize most highly-connected nodes in a dynamic, community-based network within a few steps.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1804271","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/article\/11532015","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/article\/11532015"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Liu:J","name":"Jiming Liu"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Gao:C","name":"Chao Gao"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Zhong:N","name":"Ning Zhong"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"Fundam.
