While many location systems require instrumentation of the environment, we present a system that allows devices to measure their spatial relations in a true peer-to-peer fashion. The system is based on custom sensor hardware implemented as USB dongle, and computes spatial relations in real-time. In extension of this system we propose a set of spatialized widgets for incorporation of spatial relations in the user interface. The use of these widgets is illustrated in a number of applications, showing how spatial relations can be employed to support and streamline interaction with mobile devices.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1095034.1095049","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1095034.1095049","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/998704","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/998704","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1095034.1095049","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1095034.1095049[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Kortuem:G","name":"Gerd Kortuem"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Kray:C","name":"Christian Kray"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Gellersen:H","name":"Hans Gellersen"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 18th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology (2005), pp. 93-102, doi:10.1145\/1095034.1095049ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:998704"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1095034.1095049","title":"Sensing and visualizing spatial relations of mobile devices"}}}
