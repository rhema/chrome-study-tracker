As a step in this direction, we build an accurate model for classifying user query reformulations into broad classes (generalization, specialization, error correction or parallel move), achieving 92\\% accuracy. We apply the model to automatically label two large query logs, creating annotated query-flow graphs. We study the resulting reformulation patterns, finding results consistent with previous studies done on smaller manually annotated datasets, and discovering new interesting patterns, including connections between reformulation types and topical categories. Finally, applying our findings to a third query log that is publicly available for research purposes, we demonstrate that our reformulation classifier leads to improved recommendations in a query recommendation system.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1632442","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1109\/WI-IAT.2009.34","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/article\/7954245","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/article\/7954245","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1109%2FWI-IAT.2009.34","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1109%2FWI-IAT.2009.34[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/author\/Boldi:P","name":"Paolo Boldi"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/author\/Bonchi:F","name":"Francesco Bonchi"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/author\/Castillo:C","name":"Carlos Castillo"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/author\/Vigna:S","name":"Sebastiano Vigna"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE\/WIC\/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology - Volume 01 (2009), pp. 183-190, doi:10.1109\/WI-IAT.2009.34ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:7954245"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1109\/WI-IAT.2009.34","title":"From \"Dango\" to \"Japanese Cakes\": Query Reformulation Models and Patterns"}}}
