This is performed by applying an Educational Data Mining (EDM) technology to former students curricula and their degree of success (GPA) and thus, uncovering golden didactic knowledge for successful education. We shifted strategy from an heagerh strategy of holding an explicit model towards a hlazyh strategy of mining with data, which is really available, holds empirically, and is not a result of hguessesh about the students' general characteristics. In particular, we utilize the educational history of the students and vocational ambitions for student modeling.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2356064","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1109\/ICALT.2012.212","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534148","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534148","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1109%2FICALT.2012.212","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1109%2FICALT.2012.212[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Sakurai:Y","name":"Yoshitaka Sakurai"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Takada:K","name":"Kouhei Takada"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Tsuruta:S","name":"Setsuo Tsuruta"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Knauf:R","name":"Rainer Knauf"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE 12th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (2012), pp. 3-4, doi:10.1109\/ICALT.2012.212ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11534148"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1109\/ICALT.2012.212","title":"A Case Study on Using Data Mining for University Curricula"}}}
