Unlike conventional hashing, extendible hashing has a dynamic structure that grows and shrinks gracefully as the database grows and shrinks. This approach simultaneously solves the problem of making hash tables that are extendible and of making radix search trees that are balanced. We study, by analysis and simulation, the performance of extendible hashing. The results indicate that extendible hashing provides an attractive alternative to other access methods, such as balanced trees.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=320092","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/320083.320092","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/article\/3484392","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/article\/3484392","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F320083.320092","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F320083.320092[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/author\/Fagin:R","name":"Ronald Fagin"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/author\/Nievergelt:J","name":"Jurg Nievergelt"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/author\/Pippenger:N","name":"Nicholas Pippenger"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3b\/author\/Strong:HR","name":"H.
