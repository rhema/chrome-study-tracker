Relatively few studies have systematically analyzed the motivation to create and share content, especially from the perspective of a common user. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of user posting behavior on a popular social media website, Twitter. Specifically, we assume that user behavior is mainly influenced by three factors: breaking news, posts from social friends and user's intrinsic interest, and propose a mixture latent topic model to combine all these factors. We evaluated our model on a large-scale Twitter dataset from three different perspectives: the perplexity of held-out content, the performance of predicting retweets and the quality of generated latent topics. The results were encouraging, our model clearly outperformed its competitors.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2348358","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2348283.2348358","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/article\/11533862","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/article\/11533862","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F2348283.2348358","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F2348283.2348358[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Xu:Z","name":"Zhiheng Xu"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Zhang:Y","name":"Yang Zhang"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Wu:Y","name":"Yao Wu"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Yang:Q","name":"Qing Yang"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 35th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval (2012), pp. 545-554, doi:10.1145\/2348283.2348358ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11533862"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2348283.2348358","title":"Modeling user posting behavior on social media"}}}
