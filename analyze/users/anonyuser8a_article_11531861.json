The means are longer queries that provide additional keywords.

For readers who feel insecure about the claim, our paper gives empirical evidence.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1996954","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8a\/article\/11531861","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8a\/article\/11531861"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8a\/author\/Stein:B","name":"Benno Stein"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8a\/author\/Hagen:M","name":"Matthias Hagen"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 33rd European conference on Advances in information retrieval (2011), pp. 503-509ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11531861"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8a\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","title":"Introducing the user-over-ranking hypothesis"}}}
