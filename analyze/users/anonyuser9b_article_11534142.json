Crafting controllers to generate desirable behaviors is difficult because the specification of the final outcome is indirect and often at odds with the functional control of the task. This paper presents a method which exploits the natural modal vibrations of a physically based character in order to provide a palette of basis coordinations that animators can use to assemble their desired motion. A visual user interface allows an animator to guide the final outcome by selecting and inhibiting the use of specific modes. Then, an optimization routine applies the user-chosen modes in the tuning of parameters for a fixed locomotion control structure. The result is an animation system that is easy for an animator to drive and is able to produce a wide variety of locomotion styles for varying character morphologies.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2159631","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2159616.2159631","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534142","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534142","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F2159616.2159631","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F2159616.2159631[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Nunes:RF","name":"Rubens F.
