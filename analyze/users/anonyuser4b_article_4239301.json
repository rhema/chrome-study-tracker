{"citeulike_paper":{"location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser4b\/article\/4239301","title":"The Role of Emotion in Believable Agents","abstract":"Artificial intelligence researchers attempting to create engaging, apparently living creatures may find important insight in the work of artists who have explored the idea of believable character. In particular, appropriately timed and clearly expressed emotion is a central requirement for believable characters. We discuss these ideas and suggest how they may apply to believable interactive characters, which we call \"believable agents.\" This work was supported in part by Fujitsu Laboratories and Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories.
