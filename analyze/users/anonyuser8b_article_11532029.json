We proposed an on-line search of the user's predefined group of pages. In particular, this approach is based on our model of a bee hive being augmented by a model of the behaviour of bees outside the hive and by the method of assigning the page quality. With regard to the advantages of this approach, the hive as a whole seems to be able to determine the best routes of the search and reject the bad ones. This has been indicated by our first exploration tests as we report in the paper. However, a comprehensive experimentation is necessary before definitive conclusions can be made.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1339650","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/article\/11532029","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/article\/11532029"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Navrat:P","name":"Pavol Navrat"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Jastrzembska:L","name":"Lucia Jastrzembska"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Jelinek:T","name":"Tomas Jelinek"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Ezzeddine:AB","name":"Anna B.
