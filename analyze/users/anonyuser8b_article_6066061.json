In 1990s, Ant Colony Optimization based on ant swarm and Particle Swarm Optimization based on bird flocks and fish schools have been introduced and they have been applied to solve optimization problems in various areas within a time of two decade. However, the intelligent behaviors of bee swarm have inspired the researchers especially during the last decade to develop new algorithms. This work presents a survey of the algorithms described based on the intelligence in bee swarms and their applications.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1670541","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10462-009-9127-4","http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/500886349544k37u","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/article\/6066061","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/article\/6066061","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1007%2Fs10462-009-9127-4","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1007%2Fs10462-009-9127-4[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Karaboga:D","name":"Dervis Karaboga"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser8b\/author\/Akay:B","name":"Bahriye Akay"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"Artif.
