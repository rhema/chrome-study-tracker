There are two important open questions here. The first challenge is the measure - how to quantify the goodness of a given top-k ranking list that captures both the relevance and the diversity? The second challenge lies in the algorithmic aspect - how to find an optimal, or near-optimal, top-k ranking list that maximizes the measure we defined in a scalable way? In this paper, we address these challenges from an optimization point of view. Firstly, we propose a goodness measure for a given top-k ranking list. The proposed goodness measure intuitively captures both (a) the relevance between each individual node in the ranking list and the query; and (b) the diversity among different nodes in the ranking list. Moreover, we propose a scalable algorithm (linear wrt the size of the graph) that generates a provably near-optimal solution. The experimental evaluations on real graphs demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2020573","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2020408.2020573","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/article\/9854407","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/article\/9854407","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F2020408.2020573","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F2020408.2020573[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Tong:H","name":"Hanghang Tong"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/He:J","name":"Jingrui He"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Wen:Z","name":"Zhen Wen"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Konuru:R","name":"Ravi Konuru"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser10a\/author\/Lin:CY","name":"Ching Y.
