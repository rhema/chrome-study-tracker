HITS makes the crucial distinction of hubs and authorities and computes them in a mutually reinforcing way. PageRank considers the hyperlink weight normalization and the equilibrium distribution of random surfers as the citation score. We generalize and combine these key concepts into a unified framework, in which we prove that rankings produced by PageRank and HITS are both highly correlated with the ranking by in-degree and out-degree.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/564376.564440","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser1b\/article\/11492880","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser1b\/article\/11492880","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F564376.564440","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F564376.564440[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser1b\/author\/Ding:C","name":"Chris Ding"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser1b\/author\/He:X","name":"Xiaofeng He"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser1b\/author\/Husbands:P","name":"Parry Husbands"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser1b\/author\/Zha:H","name":"Hongyuan Zha"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser1b\/author\/Simon:HD","name":"Horst D.
