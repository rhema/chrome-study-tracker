{"citeulike_paper":{"location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/article\/11527827","title":"Parallel crawlers","abstract":"In this paper we study how we can design an effective parallel crawler. As the size of the Web grows, it becomes imperative to parallelize a crawling process, in order to finish downloading pages in a reasonable amount of time. We first propose multiple architectures for a parallel crawler and identify fundamental issues related to parallel crawling. Based on this understanding, we then propose metrics to evaluate a parallel crawler, and compare the proposed architectures using 40 million pages collected from the Web. Our results clarify the relative merits of each architecture and provide a good guideline on when to adopt which architecture.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/511446.511464","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/article\/11527827","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/article\/11527827","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F511446.511464","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F511446.511464[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/author\/Cho:J","name":"Junghoo Cho"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2a\/author\/Molina:HG","name":"Hector G.
