This system, named mobile surface, can project images on any free surfaces and enable interaction in the air within the projection area. The projector used in the system scans a laser beam very quickly across the projection area to produce a stable image at 60 fps. The camera-projector synchronization is applied to obtain the image of the appointed scanning line. So our system can project what is perceived as a stable image onto the display surface, while simulta neously working as a structured light 3D scanning system.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1866270","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1866218.1866270","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534147","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534147","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1866218.1866270","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1866218.1866270[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Zhao:J","name":"Ji Zhao"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Liu:H","name":"Hujia Liu"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Zhang:C","name":"Chunhui Zhang"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Zhang:Z","name":"Zhengyou Zhang"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Adjunct proceedings of the 23nd annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology (2010), pp. 459-460, doi:10.1145\/1866218.1866270ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11534147"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1866218.1866270","title":"MobileSurface: interaction in the air for mobile computing"}}}
