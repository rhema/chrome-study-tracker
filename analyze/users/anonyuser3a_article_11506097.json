However, the large size of the Web and its dynamic nature make the task of foraging appropriate information challenging. Generalpurpose search engines and business portals may be used to gather some basic intelligence. Topical crawlers, driven by richer contexts, can then leverage on the basic intelligence to facilitate indepth and up-to-date research. In this paper we investigate the use of topical crawlers in creating a small document collection that helps locate relevant business entities. The problem of locating business entities is encountered when an organization looks for competitors, partners or acquisitions. We formalize the problem, create a test bed, introduce a metric to measure the performance of crawlers, and compare the results of four different crawlers. Our results underscore the importance of exploiting DOM based link contexts and identifying good hubs, for accelerating the crawl and improving the overall results. We further verify our findings on a real-world example.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/summary?doi=10.1.1.1.6934","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/article\/11506097","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/article\/11506097"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/author\/Pant:G","name":"Gautam Pant"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/author\/Menczer:F","name":"Filippo Menczer"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In In Proc. 7th European Conference on Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries (ECDL 2003 (0)ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:11506097"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser3a\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","title":"Topical Crawling for Business Intelligence"}}}
