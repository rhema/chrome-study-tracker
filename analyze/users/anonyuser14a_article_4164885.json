Intuitively, in the query-flow graph a directed edge from query qi to query qj means that the two queries are likely to be part of the same search mission. Any path over the query-flow graph may be seen as a possible search task, whose likelihood is given by the strength of the edges along the path. An edge (qi, qj) is also labelled with some information: e.g., the probability that user moves from qi to qj, or the type of the transition, for instance, the fact that qj is a specialization of qi. In this paper we propose, and experimentally study, query recommendations based on short random walks on the query-flow graph. Our experiments show that these methods can match in precision, and often improve, recommendations based on query-click graphs, without using users' clicks. Our experiments also show that it is important to consider transition-type labels on edges for having good quality recommendations. Finally, one feature that we had in mind while devising our methods was that of providing diverse sets of recommendations: the experimentation that we conducted provides encouraging results in this sense.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1507509.1507518","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1507509.1507518","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/article\/4164885","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/article\/4164885","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1507509.1507518","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1507509.1507518[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/author\/Boldi:P","name":"Paolo Boldi"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/author\/Bonchi:F","name":"Francesco Bonchi"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/author\/Castillo:C","name":"Carlos Castillo"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/author\/Donato:D","name":"Debora Donato"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/author\/Vigna:S","name":"Sebastiano Vigna"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 2009 workshop on Web Search Click Data (2009), pp. 56-63, doi:10.1145\/1507509.1507518ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:4164885"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser14a\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1507509.1507518","title":"Query suggestions using query-flow graphs"}}}
