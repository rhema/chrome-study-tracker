They typically also include large collections of small groups. However the most of existing approaches to crowd modeling treat a crowd either as a collection of isolated individuals, each maintaining its own goal, or as an aggregated entity in which large number of individuals share the same goal and behavior pattern.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2159616.2159659","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/2159616.2159659","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534140","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/article\/11534140","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F2159616.2159659","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F2159616.2159659[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser9b\/author\/Park:SI","name":"Seung I.
