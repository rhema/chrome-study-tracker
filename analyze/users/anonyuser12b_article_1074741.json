The similarity of multi-step neighborhoods of vertices are numerically evaluated by similarity functions including SimRank [20], a recursive refinement of cocitation; PSimRank, a novel variant with better theoretical characteristics; and the Jaccard coefficient, extended to multi-step neighborhoods. Our methods are presented in a general framework of Monte Carlo similarity search algorithms that precompute an index database of random fingerprints, and at query time, similarities are estimated from the fingerprints. The performance and quality of the methods were tested on the Stanford Webbase [19] graph of 80M pages by comparing our scores to similarities extracted from the ODP directory [26]. Our experimental results suggest that the hyperlink structure of vertices within four to five steps provide more adequate information for similarity search than single-step neighborhoods.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1060839","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1060745.1060839","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12b\/article\/1074741","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12b\/article\/1074741","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1060745.1060839","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1060745.1060839[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12b\/author\/Fogaras:D","name":"Dￃﾡniel Fogaras"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12b\/author\/R%c3%a1cz:B","name":"Balￃﾡzs Rￃﾡcz"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web (2005), pp. 641-650, doi:10.1145\/1060745.1060839ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:1074741"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12b\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1060745.1060839","title":"Scaling link-based similarity search"}}}
