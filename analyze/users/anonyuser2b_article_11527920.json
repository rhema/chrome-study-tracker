The experimental result from this study shows that the rough sets algorithm outperforms the common probabilistic network method in learning a PI model. This indicates that the rough sets algorithm can apply to learning PI domains.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=2130815","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/11548669_59","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/article\/11527920","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/article\/11527920","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1007%2F11548669_59","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1007%2F11548669_59[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser2b\/author\/Lee:JH","name":"Jae H.
