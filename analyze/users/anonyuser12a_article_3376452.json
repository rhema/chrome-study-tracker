Although some recently proposed methods can make meaningful query suggestions by mining query patterns from search logs, none of them are context-aware - they do not take into account the immediately preceding queries as context in query suggestion. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware query suggestion approach which is in two steps. In the offine model-learning step, to address data sparseness, queries are summarized into concepts by clustering a click-through bipartite. Then, from session data a concept sequence suffix tree is constructed as the query suggestion model. In the online query suggestion step, a user's search context is captured by mapping the query sequence submitted by the user to a sequence of concepts. By looking up the context in the concept sequence sufix tree, our approach suggests queries to the user in a context-aware manner. We test our approach on a large-scale search log of a commercial search engine containing 1:8 billion search queries, 2:6 billion clicks, and 840 million query sessions. The experimental results clearly show that our approach outperforms two baseline methods in both coverage and quality of suggestions.","additional_locations":{"location":["http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1401890.1401995","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1401890.1401995","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12a\/article\/3376452","http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12a\/article\/3376452","http:\/\/pubget.com\/search?q=doi:10.1145%2F1401890.1401995","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=10.1145%2F1401890.1401995[aid]&cmd=DetailsSearch"]},"authors":{"author":[{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12a\/author\/Cao:H","name":"Huanhuan Cao"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12a\/author\/Jiang:D","name":"Daxin Jiang"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12a\/author\/Pei:J","name":"Jian Pei"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12a\/author\/He:Q","name":"Qi He"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12a\/author\/Liao:Z","name":"Zhen Liao"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12a\/author\/Chen:E","name":"Enhong Chen"},{"mm_name":"authors","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12a\/author\/Li:H","name":"Hang Li"}]},"source":{"mm_name":"source","title":"In Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining (2008), pp. 875-883, doi:10.1145\/1401890.1401995ￂﾠ Key: citeulike:3376452"},"keywords":{"document":[{"mm_name":"keywords","location":"http:\/\/www.citeulike.org\/user\/anonyuser12a\/tag\/no-tag","title":"no-tag"}]},"citeulike_user":{},"scholarly_article":{"mm_name":"source_article","location":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1401890.1401995","title":"Context-aware query suggestion by mining click-through and session data"}}}
